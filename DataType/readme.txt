---FUNDAMENTAL TYPES: 

    Int,Floating point ,Boolen,byte,size_t ,void
    also called "primitive"/"built in" types because they are part of core language


    INTEGER TYPES:  this store whole number without fractional componant
        //short int, int ,long int, long long int(each can be signed+- or unsigned+)
        int are by default signed and int so you dont need to write short int instead you can write directly short
---LITERAL :    
    are hardcoded value in program like "deno",123,'a' etc.


Binary=0b111    Octal=o77   Hexa=0xfad

Converting decimal to other bases  %x for hexa %o for octal


---FLOATING POINT: stores approximations of real number (cause computer have finite amount of memory)

    float(%f),double(%lf),long double(%Lf)
